### Workflow for Code Contributions

1. Review the list of [open issues](../../issues). Choose an existing issue to work on, or create a new one to discuss your ideas.
2. It is beneficial to discuss your plans before starting work to align your efforts with project goals.
3. Fork the repository on GitHub.
4. Create a branch from the `master` branch to base your work.
5. Initiate a new pull request, label it as `work in progress`, and detail your contributions.
6. Commit your changes in logical and manageable units.
7. Ensure your commits include a sign-off (`git commit -s -m "your commit message"`).
8. Write clear and detailed commit messages.
9. Push your changes to your branch in your fork and keep your pull request updated.
10. Engage with feedback from project maintainers during the review process.
11. Once complete, remove the `work in progress` label and notify maintainers for final review.

### Commit Messages

Your pull request description should link back to the corresponding issue id for full context.

### Sign Your Work - Developer Certificate of Origin

All contributions must adhere to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1, which can be found at [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/). This certification confirms your rights to submit the changes. Including a "Signed-off-by" tag in each commit is a way to certify your agreement.

```bash
git commit -s -m "Describe your change"
```
